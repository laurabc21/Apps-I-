# Hate Speech Text Classification with SpaCy and Scattertext Visualization
Project Overview
This project aims to classify text into hate speech and non-hate speech categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages the SpaCy framework for text preprocessing and classification model training. Additionally, Scattertext is used for visualizing the results and analyzing the performance of the classification model.

Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Removal of stopwords, special characters, emojis, URLs, and other irrelevant text elements.

Text Classification: A classification model is trained to differentiate between hate speech and non-hate speech.

Visualization: Scattertext is used to create interactive visualizations of the most important words used in hate speech versus non-hate speech.
