# Hate Speech Text Classification with SpaCy and Scattertext Visualization

This project aims to classify text into hate speech and non-hate speech dataset (Tonneau, 2024) categories using the SpaCy framework for text preprocessing and classification model training. Additionally, Scattertext is used for visualizing the results and analyzing the performance of the classification model.

The following steps has been taken:

- Text Preprocessing: Removal of stopwords, special characters, emojis, URLs, and other irrelevant text elements.

- Text Classification: A classification model is trained to differentiate between hate speech and non-hate speech.

. Visualization: Scattertext has been used to create interactive visualizations of the most important words used in hate speech versus non-hate speech.
